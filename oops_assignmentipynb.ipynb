        "\n",
        "  - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming approach that organizes software design around objects rather than functions and logic.\n",
        "  - An object represents a real-world entity — like a car, student, or bank account — and contains both data (attributes) and behavior (methods).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in oop?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - A class in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a blueprint or template for creating objects.\n",
        "  - A class describes what an object is and what it can do.\n",
        "  - It defines the data (attributes) and the behavior (methods) that the objects created from it will have.\n",
        "  - For example:\n",
        "  A class is like a blueprint of a house.\n",
        "  Objects are the actual houses built from that blueprint.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in (OOP)?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - An object in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a real-world entity or an instance of a class.\n",
        "  - It represents a specific example of something defined by a class — containing both data (attributes) and behavior (methods).\n",
        "  - An object is created from a class, and it has its own data and can perform actions defined in the class.\n",
        "  For Example:\n",
        "  - Class: Car → defines features like color, model, speed, and actions like drive or stop.\n",
        "  - Object: my_car = Car(\"Red\", \"Toyota\") → a specific car with those features.\n",
        "  \n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "  - Abstraction\n",
        "  - Abstraction means showing only the essential features of an object and hiding unnecessary details from the user.\n",
        "  - It focuses on what an object does, not how it does it.\n",
        "  - Helps reduce complexity by hiding implementation details.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Encapsulation\n",
        "  - Encapsulation means wrapping data and methods into a single unit (the   class) and protecting data from outside interference or misuse.\n",
        "  - It focuses on how to protect data.\n",
        "  - Usually done using private or protected variables.\n",

        "\n",

        "\n",
        " - Dunder methods allow you to define how your objects behave with Python’s built-in operations — such as printing, comparing, adding, or initializing\n",

        "\n",
        " - Inheritance in OOP means that one class (child class) can inherit properties and behaviors (data and methods) from another class (parent class).\n",
        " - It allows code reusability and helps create a hierarchical relationship between classes.\n",
        "\n",

        " - The child inherits traits like eyes, hair color, etc., from the parent.\n",
        "   But the child can also have their own unique traits.\n",
        "   Similarly, in programming:\n",
        " - A child class inherits all attributes and methods of the parent class, but   can also add or override them.\n"
