        "\n",
        "  - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming approach that organizes software design around objects rather than functions and logic.\n",
        "  - An object represents a real-world entity — like a car, student, or bank account — and contains both data (attributes) and behavior (methods).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in oop?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - A class in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a blueprint or template for creating objects.\n",
        "  - A class describes what an object is and what it can do.\n",
        "  - It defines the data (attributes) and the behavior (methods) that the objects created from it will have.\n",
        "  - For example:\n",
        "  A class is like a blueprint of a house.\n",
        "  Objects are the actual houses built from that blueprint.\n",

        "\n",
        "  - An object in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a real-world entity or an instance of a class.\n",
        "  - It represents a specific example of something defined by a class — containing both data (attributes) and behavior (methods).\n",
        "  - An object is created from a class, and it has its own data and can perform actions defined in the class.\n",
        "  For Example:\n",
        "  - Class: Car → defines features like color, model, speed, and actions like drive or stop.\n",
        "  - Object: my_car = Car(\"Red\", \"Toyota\") → a specific car with those features.\n",

        "  - Abstraction\n",
